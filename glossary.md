# Glossary of Terms

This document defines the terms we use throughout our [Terms of Service](https://dataexchange.education/terms), [Privacy Policy](https://dataexchange.education/terms/privacy) and other DataExchange documents. Much of which is based on the UK's [Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29) and similar definitions.

A product has at least one __Version__ which offer specialisatons to products, e.g. with different features (like 'standard' or 'pro' offerings) or depending on legal restrictions and its availability. A version of a product that is available to your organisation is known as an __Application__. Applications may publish (provide) data to, and/or require (consume) data from, DataExchange.

__Deployments__ represent an installation (use) of a product within an organisation, and as such forms the basis for a legal relationship defined in data sharing agreements.

__Data Integrator__ is a data processor of data under the DPA. They facilitate the secure transmission of data between the data provider and the data consumer.

__Data Sharing Agreement__ means a legally binding contract that defines what data is shared and to which parties. DataExchange uses two forms of data sharing agreements:

1. __Two Party__, between a data provider (i.e. an educational institution) and a data integrator (i.e. ZiNET Data Solutions Limited, the owner and operator of DataExchange). This defines under what conditions the data integrator is to receive and process data from the data provider. What data is to be processed is defined as the sum of all three party data sharing agreements involving the data provider and data integrator.
1. __Three Party__, between a data provider (i.e. an educational institution), a data integrator (i.e. ZiNET Data Solutions Limited, the owner and operator of DataExchange), and a data consumer (i.e. an educational technology tool/service provider). It defines what data is required by the data consumer for the service they provide, what the data provider will allow access to, and that the data integrator agrees to facilitate the data sharing.

__IP Address__ is a unique computer address that identifies you to the Internet, or your Local Area Network (LAN).

__Relevant Filing System__ means any set of information relating to individuals to the extent that, although the information is not processed by means of equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose, the set is structured, either by reference to individuals or by reference to criteria relating to individuals, in such a way that specific information relating to a particular individual is readily accessible.
