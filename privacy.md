## Introduction

Privacy and security are at the heart of everything we do at DataExchange. This statement explains the key measures we’ve put in place to ensure that data is kept secure and processed appropriately at all times. It also covers our commitments to our users, and what we expect from organisations in terms of privacy and data protection.

For further detail, please refer to our full [Terms of Service](https://dataexchange.education/terms).

## Our Principles

__We:__

* Process data for purposes necessary to provide the DataExchange service and services explicitly deployed to your organisation.
* Adhere strictly to the terms of the [Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29) and the [General Data Protection Regulation 2018](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) and any future amendments or applicable legislation.
* Only store and process the minimum data required to provide access to DataExchange and its applications, and to inform you in advance what data that application requires.
* Transport and store all data originating from schools using modern and best practice encryption technologies.  This includes Secure Socket Layers (SSL/TLS) for encrypted data transfer over the internet, encryption of all data at rest, field-level encryption for personally identifiable data and password-protected identities for all end users
* Comply with all Subject Access Requests made relating to the data we store as data controller. Subject Access Requests for data that we process as a data integrator should be directed to the data provider.
* Only retain data for as long as required.
* Always maintain adequate liability insurance.
* Report any breaches of security to the data controller, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and other authorities if required by law, and, in co-operation with the data controller, to data subjects.
* Always notify an organisation prior to deploying an application, inform the organisation what data is required, and allow the request to be accepted or rejected.
* Make the [Terms of Service](https://dataexchange.education/terms) and this Privacy Policy clearly and publicly available on our website.

__We DO NOT:__

* Store or transport personal or sensitive data outside of the UK, EU or outside of countries which are granted to have [Adequate Levels of Protection](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm) as defined by the European Commission where the data originates within such a country.
* Share data with third parties except where explicitly requested by the data controller or required by law.
* Claim ownership or exclusive rights over any of the data processed or created as part of services provided to an organisation.

## Security and Encryption

We take every reasonable measure to ensure we store data securely. DataExchange is developed using secure technologies, which include, but are not limited to the following:

* All data transmissions to and from DataExchange are encrypted using modern SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.
* Encryption at rest i.e. when stored on a disk.
* Field level encryption, where we feel it necessary to do so.
* Encrypted passwords and role-based access controls are used to access DataExchange
* All servers are situated in secure locations that comply with the Data Protection Act 1998

## Staff access to data

DataExchange does not look ‘under the hood’ or inspect any of the data we store.  The only exceptions to this are where an organisation has explicitly given us permission to do so; for example, to provide technical support to correct a technical problem. This permission is given on an ‘as needed’ basis and the ability to access the data is revoked once the technical problem is resolved.

All our staff, including contractors, are required to agree to strict confidentiality and non-disclosure clauses in their employment contracts.

## Deleting and Retaining Data

DataExchange retains data for as long as necessary to provide an organisation access to their services. If an organisation.  We will also delete personal data if we detect that an account has been inactive for a significant amount of time.

## DataExchange and Applications

Organisations are responsible for accepting any terms and conditions of third party (vendor) applications.

Before we allow data interchange (exchange) between parties through DataExchange require all parties involved to sign appropriate data sharing agreements that define the scope of data transfer/access. These agreements can be revoked at any time by any party.
